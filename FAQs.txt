What is UserServices?
- A class that simply checks if the user can enter/proceed with the website (static siya soo you can call it anywhere.)

When do I use doGet and doPost?
- It depends. Reminder: doGet is usually called with response.sendRedirect(); and doPost is usually called with request.getRequestDispatcher...
P.S: The method=post also calls the doPost when submitting or clicking something yata? clicking == href

Why cookies? 
- Kailangan eh :C

What is the difference between adding shit to session and adding shit to the request?
- hmm best example for this is this code block:
	request.setAttribute();
	response.sendRedirect();
		vs.
	request.getSession().setAttribute();
	response.sendRedirect();

First block of code wont be able to save the values inside the request while the second remains throughout the session.

 
May tanong ka pa na wala dito?
- pm mo ko bading :c
